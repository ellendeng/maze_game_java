# maze_game_java
A simple game in Java

The HungrySquirrelGame class defines the main method. The flow of the main method can be something like this:
1. Call the create method of the Maze class to create the maze.
2. Create a Squirrel object. This creates the squirrel and puts the squirrel in the maze
based on the user input.
3. Instantiate an array of Nut objects and determine and create the type of nut (almond
or peanut).
4. Display the maze with all the entities created.
5. Accept user input to move the squirrel.
6. For every move the full maze with all the entities should be displayed.
7. Every time the squirrel eats a nut, program prints the points collected for the new nut
and total points collected thus far.
!!! Squirrel ate Almond and gained 5 points (Total 15 points) !!!
8. Once the squirrel collects all the nuts, a message must be displayed and the game is over.
“Squirrel successfully collected all the nuts. Total points 30.” “Thank you for playing this game”
